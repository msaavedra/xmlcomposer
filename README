This package is based off a project I wrote over a decade ago. At the time,
I had very little professional development experience, and was learning
both python and general web backend programming.

In those days there were not many options in python for dynamically producing
XML and HTML. I found myself mixing large strings containing chunks of XML
in with my python code, and the result was a horrible mess. I wrote this
module so that I could generate markup programatically.

Nowadays, there are a ton of options, several entire frameworks in fact, for
producing web documents using python. One commonality between them (and 
similar frameworks in other languages) is the use of templates that mix
logic with markup. I look at them and it always brings me back to the
horrible mess I was writing back in 1999. I wanted something with a different
approach, that completely separated logic and content.

Therefore, I have dusted off the old package, updated it to more modern
python, corrected many errors and design flaws, and generally made it more
useful. For all intents and purposes, it has become a total rewrite.

To install, copy or symlink the xmlcomposer subdirectory into your
python path.

Documentation and a tutorial will be coming soon.
